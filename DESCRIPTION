Description: A function library that provides a pipeline for the comparative analysis of 
  collective movement data (e.g. fish schools, bird flocks, baboon troops) by 
  processing 2-dimensional positional data (x,y,t) from GPS trackers or computer
  vision tracking systems, discretizing events of collective motion, calculating
  a set of established metrics that characterize each event, and placing the
  events in a multi-dimensional 'swarm space' constructed from these metrics.
