Description: The package provides a pipeline for the comparative analysis of collective movement data (e.g. fish schools, bird flocks, baboon troops) by processing 2-dimensional positional data (x,y,t) from GPS trackers or computer vision tracking systems, discretizing events of collecitve motion, calculating a set of established metrics that characterize each event, and placing the events in a multi-dimensional 'swarm space' constructed from these metrics.
