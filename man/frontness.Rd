\usage{
frontness(bs)

\item{bs}{A vector of bearing angles (in rad) between objects.}
}
\value{
A vector of the same length as bs representing the frontness of
a focal object to its neighbor.
}
\description{
Given the bearing angle of an object to another, this function
 calculates the frontness, a value that ranges from 0 to 1 and represents how
 in front the focal object is from its neighbor.
