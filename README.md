## Description 
 An R package for the comparative analysis of collective motion data in the swarm space. 
Based on the packages [`trackdf`](https://github.com/swarm-lab/trackdf) and [`swaRm`](https://github.com/swarm-lab/swaRm), `**swaRmverse**' aims to standardize how data of collective motion are analyzed and support the comparison of properties within and across species and contexts.
