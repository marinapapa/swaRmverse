## Description 
An R package for the comparative analysis of collective motion data in the swarm space. 
Based on the packages [`trackdf`](https://github.com/swarm-lab/trackdf) and [`swaRm`](https://github.com/swarm-lab/swaRm), [`swaRmverse`](https://github.com/marinapapa/swaRmverse) aims to standardize how data of collective motion are analyzed and support the comparison of properties within and across species and contexts.

[`swaRmverse`](https://github.com/marinapapa/swaRmverse) is a work in progress, functions are likely to change as the package gets developed. 

### Acknowledgements
The development of this package was supported by the [2G-SWARM](https://www.shoalgroup.org/2g-swarm) ONR grant awarded to Dr. Andrew J. King at Swansea University (UK).
